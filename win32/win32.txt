Global under Windows

Global requires the GNU programs sed.exe, sort.exe, uniq.exe be the path.
Note that the sort that comes with Windows does not support multikey sorting
which is required by global. To avoid using that version of sort, the directory
containing the GNU version must be first in your PATH.

The GNU utilities listed above may be downloaded from:
<http://www.edv.agrar.tu-muenchen.de/~syring/win32/UnxUtils.html>

All paths are expected to use the UNIX directory separator '/' instead of
the DOS/Windows '\'. This includes the Global-specific environment variables
as well as paths given on command lines.  However, the path separators
expected for the PATH and GTAGSLIBPATH environment variables are expected
to be the DOS-style ';' instead of the UNIX-style ':'.

The included file win32\global.conf must also be copied to a convenient
location and the GTAGSCONF environment variable must be set to its name
(e.g. set GTAGCONF=c:/global/global.conf)

To compile Global under Windows, manually change to each directory
in turn and in each type 'make -N -fmakefile.w32' (the libutil and libdb
directories must be done first). The result will be an executable file
or a library in each directory. Copy the executables into a directory on
yoru PATH.

Global 3.44 has been tested under Windows NT 4.0 with Borland C++ 4.5
