Description: Source code search and browse.
 GLOBAL is a source code tag system that works the same way across
 diverse environments. Currently, it supports the following:
 .
    o Shell command line (see 'Global')
    o nvi editor (see 'Extended nvi using global')
    o emacs editor (see 'Emacs using global')
    o Web browser (see 'Hypertext generator')
    o Elvis editor (see 'Elvis using global')
 .
 Supported languages are C/C++ Yacc and Java.
 You can locate a specified function in the source files and move
 there easily. It is especially useful for hacking large projects
 containing many subdirectories, many '#ifdef' and many main()
 functions, like X or kernel source.
 .
 GLOBAL consists of global(1), gtags(1), htags(1),
 an extended nvi(1), gtags.el and gozilla(1).
 .
 This package include the htmake(1) extension which allows GLOBAL's
 hypertext search function to be implemented from a single central
 cgi script.
